# Delivery-System
## This project was built by Charles and Robert to implement the feature of tracking order details through real time map directions for the rider to the user.
### We encountered several challenges:
1. We need a google api key. Initially we used boxmap but its inefficient to fetch data.
2. As I search my hometown using boxmap it returns wrong data thats why we need a google api key for google maps.
3. Mapbox docs especially the search feature is not easy to use.
